Tables show per-gene probabilities of *de novo* variation
Probabilities are per chromosome, per generation.  To obtain probabilities for a cohort, multiply by 2 (to get diploid probability), then by the number of people in the population.
Unless otherwise indicates, probability tables are adjusted for typical exome sequencing coverage & mega-base scale inter-species divergence.

probTable_Samocha2014
original probability table from Samocha 2014
source data = "fixed_mut_prob_fs_adjdepdiv"
uses refseq transcripts
gene ids are ??

###
internal data (denovolyzeR:::pDNM)
updated table, based on canonical Gencode transcripts
source data = "hgnc_annotated_depthadj_pmuts_fs_canonical_transcripts_div_Feb07"
ENST represent the transcript that were used to calculate probabilities
hgnc identifiers are also provided for convenience
