Tables show per-gene probabilities of *de novo* variation  
Probabilities are per chromosome, per generation.  To obtain probabilities for a cohort, multiply by 2 (to get diploid probability), then by the number of people in the population.  
Unless otherwise indicates, probability tables are adjusted for typical exome sequencing coverage & mega-base scale inter-species divergence.

probTable_Samocha2014  
original probability table from Samocha 2014  
source data = "fixed_mut_prob_fs_adjdepdiv"  
uses refseq transcripts  
gene ids are ??  

###
internal data (denovolyzeR:::pDNM)  
updated table, based on canonical Gencode transcripts  
source data = "hgnc_annotated_depthadj_pmuts_fs_canonical_transcripts_div_Feb07"  
ENST represent the transcript that were used to calculate probabilities  
hgnc identifiers are also provided for convenience
